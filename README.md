## Overview

**Project Title**: My Flashcards

**Project Description**: A small and simple app that allows you to add and use flashcards

**Project Goals**: To create a simple flashcard app and learn react native

## Instructions for Build and Use

1. cd into the correct directory (FlashCardApp folder)
2. open a new terminal and type "npm start"
3. run using expo or scan QR code in terminal using expo go

Instructions for using the software:

1. Click "get started"
2. Click on flashcards to flip them

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* VS Code
* Expo SDK 53.0.10
* @react-navigation/native & @react-navigation/native-stack

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [React Native API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibilityinfo)
* [React Native Components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis)
* [YouTube ProgrammingwithMosh Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I have some of the flashcards hardcoded in App.js which makes it so you can't permanently "delete" them. If you try, you'll delete them, but they'll come back when you leave the page and return. This needs to get fixed.
* [ ] I want to add more features including the ability to sort your flashcards into categories
* [ ] I want to add a login/logout functionality so the user has the ability to save their flashcards and come back to them whenever they like
* [ ] I want to change the style sheets to be more user friendly. I'm particularly bothered by the "Create new flashcard" button being underneath the home/back buttons on some devices.
